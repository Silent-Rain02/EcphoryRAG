David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer.\n1. He is best known for films such as \"Eraserhead\" (1977), \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990–91 television series \"Twin Peaks\", which led to him being labeled \"the first popular Surrealist\" by noted film critic Pauline Kael.\n2. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival.\n3. He has been described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the most important director of this era\", while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\".\n4. Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films.\n5. He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film \"Eraserhead\" (1977).\n6. After \"Eraserhead\" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success.\n7. He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic \"Dune\" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.\n8. Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled \"Twin Peaks\" (1990–1991).\n9. He also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) and a family film \"The Straight Story\" (1999) in the same period.\n10. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: \"Lost Highway\" (1997), \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), and \"Inland Empire\" (2006).\n11. Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated \"DumbLand\" (2002) and the surreal sitcom \"Rabbits\" (2002).\n12. Lynch and Frost reunited for a third season of \"Twin Peaks\", airing in on Showtime in 2017.\n13. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole.\n14. Lynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums—\"BlueBOB\" (2001), \"Crazy Clown Time\" (2011) and \"The Big Dream\" (\n15. 2013)—as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books—\"Images\" (1994), \"Catching the Big Fish\" (2006), and \"Room to Dream\" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" (2006).\n16. An avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.\n17.

He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV.\n2. He lived in a period during which there was a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians.\n3. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII.\n4. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king.\n5. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed.\n6. Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers,\n7. Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III.\n8. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC.\n9. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI.\n10. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved.\n11. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians' accounts.\n12. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII.\n13. The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery.\n14. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC).\n15. The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated.\n16. Other accounts exist:\n17. the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans for help in having him reinstated on the throne.\n18. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians.\n19.

Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, (\"Kirill Vladimirovich Romanov\"; – 12 October 1938) was a son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Alexander II and a first cousin of Nicholas II, Russia’s last Tsar.\n1. Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Russian navy serving during twenty years in the Naval Guards.\n2. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904.\n3. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n4. They wed in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II prohibition.\n5. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia.\n6. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909.\n7. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage.\n8. During World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy.\n9. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government.\n10. During the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son.\n11. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac.\n12. With the murder of his cousins Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924.\n13. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926.\n14. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.\n15.

Fleetwood Sheppard (sometimes spelled as \"Shepphard,Sheppheard,\" and \"Sheppeard\") (1 January 1634 – 25 August 1698) was a British courtier and literary wit who was instrumental in the courts of Charles II of England and William of Orange.\n1. He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s.\n2. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657.\n3. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255).\n4. Instead, Sheppard became a courtier.\n5. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset).\n6. He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life.\n7. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony á Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as \"a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,\" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke.\n8. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household.\n9. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land.\n10. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of £200.\n11. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together.\n12. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country.\n13. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life.\n14. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern.\n15. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either.\n16. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement.\n17. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour.\n18. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage.\n19. For this, he employed Sheppard.\n20. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf.\n21. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\"\n22. In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly.\n23. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king.\n24. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter.\n25. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others.\n26. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair.\n27. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents.\n28. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon.\n29. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change.\n30. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses.\n31. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died.\n32. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years.\n33. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead.\n34. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead.\n35. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old."}, {"id": "2wiki_ada1b358085211ebbd58ac1f6bf848b6_2", "title": "Nicholas Sheppard", "chunk": "Title: Nicholas Sheppard\n0.

He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.\n2. He was assassinated in 1610 by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII.\n3. The son of Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme and Jeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, Henry was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother.\n4. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother's death.\n5. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.\n6. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army.\n7. He and his predecessor Henry III of France were direct descendants of Saint-King Louis IX.\n8. Henry III belonged to the House of Valois, descended from Philip III of France, elder son of Saint Louis; Henry IV belonged to the House of Bourbon, descended from Robert, Count of Clermont, younger son of Saint Louis.\n9. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was \"first prince of the blood\".\n10. Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law.\n11. He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France's crown as a Protestant.\n12. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith.\n13. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a \"politique\"), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era.\n14. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion.\n15. Considered a usurper by some Catholics and a traitor by some Protestants, Henry became target of at least 12 assassination attempts.\n16. An unpopular king among his contemporaries, Henry gained more status after his death.\n17. He was admired for his repeated victories over his enemies and his conversion to Catholicism.\n18. The \"Good King Henryle bon roi Henri\") was remembered for his geniality and his great concern about the welfare of his subjects.\n19. An active ruler, he worked to regularise state finance, promote agriculture, eliminate corruption and encourage education.\n20. During his reign, the French colonization of the Americas truly began with the foundation of the colony of Acadia and its capital Port-Royal.\n21.

Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock,( 13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema.\n1. Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 – 1965).\n2. His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n3. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company.\n4. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925).\n5. His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British.\n6. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century.\n7. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood.\n8. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946).\n9. \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.\n10. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear.\n11. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot.\n12. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"\n13. After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954).\n14. By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.\n15. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics.\n16. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943).\n17.

Maria Luisa of Spain  (6 July 1782 – 13 March 1824) was a Spanish infanta, daughter of King Charles IV and his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma.\n1. In 1795, she married her first cousin Louis, Hereditary Prince of Parma.\n2. She spent the first years of her married life at the Spanish court where their first child, Charles, was born.\n3. In 1801 the Treaty of Aranjuez made her husband King of Etruria, a kingdom created from the former Duchy of Tuscany in exchange for the renunciation of the Duchy of Parma.\n4. They arrived in Florence, the capital of the new kingdom, in August 1801.\n5. During a brief visit to Spain in 1802, Maria Luisa gave birth to her second child.\n6. Her husband's reign in Etruria was marred by his ill health.\n7. He died in 1803, at the age of 30, following an epileptic crisis.\n8. Maria Luisa acted as regent for their son.\n9. During her government in Florence, she tried to gain the support of her subjects, but her administration of Etruria was cut short by Napoleon Bonaparte, who forced her to leave with her children in December 1807.\n10. As part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Napoleon incorporated Etruria to his domains.\n11. After a futile interview with Napoleon in Milan, Maria Luisa looked for refuge in exile with her family in Spain.\n12. The Spanish court was deeply divided and a month after her arrival the country was thrown into unrest when a popular uprising, known as the Mutiny of Aranjuez, forced Maria Luisa's father to abdicate in favor of her brother Ferdinand VII.\n13. Napoleon invited father and son to Bayonne, France, with the excuse of acting as a mediator, but gave the kingdom to his brother Joseph.\n14. Napoleon called the remaining members of the Spanish royal family to France and at their departure on 2 May 1808, the citizens of Madrid rose up against the French occupation.\n15. In France, Maria Luisa was reunited in exile with her parents.\n16. She was the only member of the Spanish royal family to directly oppose Napoleon.\n17. After her secret plan to escape was discovered, Maria Luisa was separated from her son and placed with her daughter as prisoners in a Roman convent.\n18. Maria Luisa, mostly known as the Queen of Etruria during her lifetime, regained her freedom in 1814 at the fall of Napoleon.\n19. In the following years she continued to live in Rome, hoping to recover her son's former domains.\n20. To put forward her case she wrote a book of memoirs, but was disappointed when the Congress of Vienna (1814–15) compensated her not with Parma, but with the smaller Duchy of Lucca, which had been carved out of Tuscany.\n21. As a consolation she was allowed to retain the honors of a queen.\n22. Initially reluctant to accept this accord, Maria Luisa did not take the government of Lucca until December 1817.\n23. As a reigning duchess of Lucca, she disregarded the constitution imposed by the Congress of Vienna.\n24.

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic.\n2. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile.\n3. \" Generalísimo\" Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor.\n4. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941.\n5. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state.\n6. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies.\n7. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza.\n8. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid.\n9. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens.\n10. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe.\n11. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974.\n12. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977.\n13. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy.\n14. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy.\n15. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name.\n16. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero- America.\n17. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant- hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain.\n18. In 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI."}, {"id": "2wiki_b5e9ef2c0bdd11eba7f7acde48001122_5", "title": "Juan Carlos Pérez Frías", "chunk": "Title: Juan Carlos Pérez Frías\n0.

The Dillinger Escape Plan is an American mathcore band from Morris Plains, New Jersey.\n1. Formed in 1997, the group originally featured vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, lead guitarist Ben Weinman, rhythm guitarist Derek Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie, although Brantley left after only two shows.\n2. The remaining four members recorded the band's self-titled debut EP in 1997, before John Fulton replaced Brantley for the subsequent tour and 1998's \"Under the Running Board\".\n3. Shortly after the second EP's release, Fulton left the band due to \"creative differences\", and in early 1999 Doll was forced to cease involvement due to a spinal injury suffered in a road traffic accident.\n4. As a result, Weinman performed all guitars and bass on the band's full-length debut album \"Calculating Infinity\", released in 1999.\n5. Following the release of \"Calculating Infinity\", Brian Benoit replaced Fulton and Jeff Wood took Doll's place; Wood left the band in 2000 due to the ongoing effects of a gunshot wound to the head sustained in 1992, and was replaced by Liam Wilson.\n6. In April 2001, it was announced that Minakakis had decided to leave The Dillinger Escape Plan to pursue \"non-music related endeavors\", with the band briefly placed on hiatus.\n7. The vocalist was replaced later in the year by Greg Puciato, who was chosen from \"over one hundred\" singers who auditioned by submitting a recording of \"43% Burnt\" to the band.\n8. In between the departure of Minakakis and the addition of Puciato, the band recorded the EP\n9. \"Irony Is a Dead Scene\" with Faith No More and\n10. Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, which was released in 2002.\n11. In 2004, the band released its first album with Puciato on vocals, \"Miss Machine\".\n12. Later in the year, Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand which affected his ability to play guitar; after attempting to continue, he was forced to leave the band in April 2005 and was replaced by James Love.\n13. During a tour in 2006, tensions arose between Weinman and Pennie, with the guitarist briefly leaving the band citing \"undisclosed personal reasons\".\n14. Pennie eventually left the band in 2007 to join Coheed and Cambria, with Gil Sharone replacing him for the band's third album \"Ire Works\".\n15. Also in 2007, guitarist Jeff Tuttle was added to the band due to Love's unavailability.\n16. By the beginning of 2009, Sharone had left the band and been replaced by Billy Rymer. \"\n17. Option Paralysis\" was released in 2010, which marked Tuttle's first contribution to the band (he performed additional vocals, with Weinman recording all guitars).\n18. The guitarist later left the band in August 2012 to attend film school.\n19. Love rejoined the band as Tuttle's replacement, although was not featured on the 2013 album \"\n20. One of Us Is the Killer\".\n21. After a brief hiatus, Love was replaced by Kevin Antreassian in 2015.\n22. The band released \"Dissociation\" in 2016, which was presented as the group's final album before embarking on an indefinite hiatus the following year.\n23. In the liner notes of \"Dissociation\" the band listed everyone who was a member or a part of the band in some other way or another.\n24. The list states \"\n25.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_844fe30c0bda11eba7f7acde48001122_3", "title": "Giacomo Manzù", "chunk": "Title: Giacomo Manzù\n0.

The idea stems from the Arthurian legend about the Knights of the Round Table in Camelot.\n2. Today, round tables are often used at conferences involving many parties.\n3. The most famous modern round table was the one used for talks between the Communist government and Solidarity in Poland in 1989; see: Polish Round Table Agreement.\n4. Hence, the term\" round table\" is also used figuratively to refer to a peaceful way of achieving a compromise solution."}, {"id": "2wiki_8eaa7497095c11ebbdaeac1f6bf848b6_8", "title": "East German Round Table", "chunk": "Title: East German Round Table\n0. Round table primarily refers to the Central Round Table(\" Zentraler Runder Tisch\"), a series of meetings during the Peaceful Revolution in East Germany in late- 1989 and early- 1990.\n1. The Round table first convened in East Berlin on 7 December 1989, the day after Egon Krenz had resigned as the head of the Socialist Unity Party( SED) government.\n2. This Round Table, modeled after the Polish Round Table convened in April 1989, was initiated by the group Democracy Now.\n3. \" Round table\" was to be understood in a methaphoric sense, meaning that the participants were on a par with each other.\n4. Physically, the table was rectangular( unlike the Polish model which was literally round).\n5. It was set up as a forum in which members of East German government- aligned organizations( such as the so- called bloc parties, trade unions, etc.) came together with representatives of the new citizens ’ movements( such as Democracy Now, Democratic Awakening, and New Forum) to discuss and advance reforms in the German Democratic Republic( East Germany), advising the executive until free elections could be held.\n6. There were 39 representatives at the Central Round Table, 33 of whom were entitled to vote.\n7. Seventeen of them represented new oppositional groups and political parties, and sixteen were from political parties and organizations that had been part of the communist- dominated East German government.\n8. Three, representing women, consumers and environmentalists, had observer status.\n9. The final three members were the moderators, all clergymen, from the Protestant, Catholic and Methodist churches, who did not have a vote.\n10. At first most participants hoped to reform the East German government and thus retain the country ’s independence, but as popular opinion moved towards rapid unification with West Germany, these hopes were dashed.\n11. The Round Table's first three meetings, held on 7, 18 and 22 December 1989, took place in the Protestant church's Bonhoeffer House near Friedrichstraße in Berlin- Mitte.\n12. Because popular interest created a need for more space, from the fourth meeting on 27 December to the sixteenth and final meeting on 12 March 1990, the Round Table met in the conference building of the SED- dominated Council of Ministers in Ossietzky St. near Schönhausen Palace in Berlin- Pankow.\n13. During the first meeting the Round Table decided to dissolve the\" Office for National Security\"( the organization that succeeded the Stasi), to hold free elections for the East German Parliament(\" Volkskammer\") on 6 May 1990( in January the election was preponed to 18 March 1990), and to draft a new constitution, a project that was completed by a subcommittee and presented on 4 April 1990, but never discussed by the newly elected\" Volkskammer\".\n14. Modeled after this Central Round Table, many local round tables were set up in cities and towns across East Germany.\n15. In general they continued to exist until the May 6, 1990 local elections constituted new local governments."}, {"id": "2wiki_8eaa7497095c11ebbdaeac1f6bf848b6_9", "title": "Sathyavan Savithri", "chunk": "Title: Sathyavan Savithri\n0.

Odo( or Hodo) I( also\" Huodo\" or\" Huoto\")( c. 930 – 13 March 993) was margrave in the Saxon Eastern March of the Holy Roman Empire from 965 until his death.\n1. Odo was, if the onomastics are correct, a son( or maybe a nephew) of Christian( d. 950), a Saxon count in the Nordthüringgau and Schwabengau of Eastphalia.\n2. Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda( d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast\" marca Geronis\" in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs.\n3. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river.\n4. In 965, Margrave Gero died and his great\" marca Geronis\" was divided into five smaller marches.\n5. Count Thietmar, a known son of Hidda, and Odo inherited large parts of his march:\n6. Odo received the so- called\" marca Orientalis\" or Eastern March, stretching from the Gau Serimunt in the west up to the remotest outposts on the Bóbr river in the east, while Thietmar appeared as margrave of southern Meissen after 970.\n7. Both are buried at Nienburg Abbey, a foundation of Thietmar and his brother Archbishop Gero of Cologne, which too provides evidence of their probable relationship.\n8. As a young man, Margrave Odo had shared the tutorship of Otto's son( later Otto II) with the boy's step- uncle William, Archbishop of Mainz.\n9. Archbishop William taught literature and culture; Margrave Odo taught war and legal customs.\n10. Odo spent the first years of his rule subduing the Slavic tribes settling in the eastern parts of the Saxon Ostmark.\n11. He held comital rights in the gau of Nizizi, comprising the lands between the Mulde, Elbe and Black Elster rivers, and appeared with the title\" marchio\"( margrave) only in 974, though he had held further marcher territories( officially as a county) since 965.\n12. In that same year( 974), Odo was made Count in the Saxon Nordthüringgau, still rivalling with Margrave Thietmar.\n13. Odo is chiefly known for his quarrels with the Polish duke Mieszko I.\n14. The West Slavic Polans had established a state east of the Saxon marches and, aiming to advance into the Pomeranian lands north of the Warta river, had reached an agreement with late Margrave Gero and Emperor Otto I: Mieszko's ducal title was confirmed and the Polans paid a recurring tribute to the emperor, which was collected by Margrave Odo.\n15. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, apparently quite gladly, relates that Odo's reputation with Mieszko was such that the duke of Poland\" would not have dared while wearing his fur coat to enter a house where he knew the margrave to be, or to remain seated when the margrave stood up.\"\n16. When in 972 the Polans again marched for the Baltic trade centre of Wolin, they entered into open conflict with Odo.\n17. The margrave, intending to compel Mieszko to pay tribute for the Pomeranian territory between the Oder and Warta rivers, invaded that region.\n18. Aged Emperor\n19. Otto, engaged in the marriage of his son\n20. Otto II with Princess Theophanu at far- off\n21. Rome, ordered them to cease until he himself could arbitrate their dispute.\n22. However, Odo attacked Mieszko's forces and was defeated on 24 June at the Battle of Cedynia.\n23. The belligerents reconciled at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg one year later.\n24. In 983, Odo took part in the attempts to suppress the Great Slav Rising of the Polabian Lutici tribes, but was not able to prevent the loss of the Saxon Northern March.\n25. He also failed to succeed Thietmar in the Margraviate of Meissen in 979.\n26. Odo left a son, Siegfried( d. 1030), who became a monk at Nienburg, but left the monastery on his father's death to claim his inheritance.\n27. He did however not prevail against Thietmar's son Gero II, who became Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark in 993.\n28. Siegfried again appeared as a count from 1015, when he claimed the Saxon Ostmark from Gero's son Thietmar IV and allied with Duke Mieszko II of Poland in the German- Polish War.\n29. Thietmar IV prevailed with the support by Emperor Henry II, but lost the eastern parts of his march to Mieszko II in the 1018 Peace of Bautzen."}, {"id": "2wiki_04a544a40bde11eba7f7acde48001122_4", "title": "Dedi II, Margrave of Lusatia", "chunk": "Title: Dedi II, Margrave of Lusatia\n0.

David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) was a British statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1916 and 1922.\n1. He was the final Liberal to hold the post.\n2. Lloyd George was born in Manchester to Welsh parents.\n3. His father—a schoolmaster—died in 1864 and he was raised in Wales by his mother and her shoemaker brother, whose Liberal politics and Baptist faith strongly influenced Lloyd George; the same uncle helped the boy embark on a career as a solicitor after leaving school.\n4. Lloyd George became active in local politics, gaining a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberalism which championed nonconformism and the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales, equality for labourers and tenant farmers, and reform of landownership.\n5. In 1890, he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs, in which seat he remained for fifty-five years.\n6. Lloyd George served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet from 1905.\n7. After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n8. To fund extensive welfare reforms, he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the \"People's Budget\" (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected.\n9. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911.\n10. His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state.\n11. In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal but he remained in office and struggled to impose Irish Home Rule until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation.\n12. As wartime Chancellor, Lloyd George strengthened the country's finances and forged agreements with trade unions to maintain production.\n13. In 1915, Asquith formed a Liberal-led wartime coalition with the Conservatives and Labour.\n14. Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded production.\n15. In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and clashes with the military establishment over strategy.\n16. Amid stalemate on the Western Front, confidence in Asquith's leadership waned.\n17. He was forced to resign in December 1916; Lloyd George succeeded him as Prime Minister, supported by the Conservatives and some Liberals.\n18. He centralised authority through a smaller war cabinet, a new Cabinet Office and his \"Garden Suburb\" of advisers.\n19. To combat food shortages he implemented the convoy system, established rationing, and stimulated farming.\n20. After supporting the disastrous French Nivelle Offensive in 1917, he had to reluctantly approve Field Marshal Haig's plans for the Battle of Passchendaele which resulted in huge casualities with little strategic benefit.\n21. Against the views of his commanders, he was finally able to see the Allies brought under one command in March 1918.\n22. The war effort turned to their favour that August and was won in November.\n23. In the aftermath, he and the Conservatives maintained their coalition with popular support following the December 1918 \"Coupon\" election.\n24. His government had extended the franchise to all men and some women earlier in the year.\n25. Lloyd George was a major player in Paris Peace Conference of 1919 but the situation in Ireland worsened that year, erupting into the Irish War of Independence which lasted until Lloyd George negotiated independence for the Irish Free State in 1921.\n26. At home he initiated reforms to education and housing but trade union militancy entered record levels, the economy became depressed in 1920 and unemployment rose; spending cuts followed (1921–22) and he was embroiled in a scandal over the sale of honours and the Chanak Crisis in 1922.\n27. Bonar Law won backbench support for the Conservatives to contend the next election alone.\n28. Lloyd George resigned; with his party split between his and Asquith's supporters, his faction won less than 60 seats in the 1922 election.\n29. The next year the pair reunited to oppose Stanley Baldwin's tariff proposal which he put to the country.\n30. The Liberals made gains in 1923 but remained third after the Conservatives and Labour, propping up a Labour minority government; they never regained their status as second party and, when the Labour government fell, went down to just over 40 seats in 1924 under Asquith.\n31. Lloyd George led the Liberals from 1926 to 1931, putting forward innovative proposals for public works; this failed to convert into seats in 1929 and from 1931 he was a marginalised and mistrusted figure heading a small rump of breakaway Liberals opposed to the National Government.\n32. He declined an offer to serve in Winston Churchill's War Cabinet in 1940 and was raised to the peerage in 1945, shortly before his death.\n33. Lloyd George has often been ranked highly among modern British prime ministers, but his legacy remains complicated and controversial.\n34. Scholars have praised his welfare reforms and his efforts to mobilise and lead Britain to victory during the First World War, but he has also been criticised for adopting a \"presidential\" style of leadership, for distrusting his own commanders during the war, and for his strategic failures and involvement in various scandals.\n35. His legacies over Ireland and the Treaty of Versailles are also controversial.\n36. In the post-war period, he arguably alienated many of the workers he had earlier championed, helping to swell Labour's popular support at the Liberals' expense (not helped by his conflicts with Asquithian Liberals after 1916)."}, {"id": "2wiki_041581680bdc11eba7f7acde48001122_2", "title": "A.

She was educated at Clapham High School, where in the fifth form she had made friends with Mair, Lloyd George's oldest daughter, and then at Royal Holloway College where she studied Classics.\n4. In July 1911, Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, hired Stevenson as a governess for his youngest daughter Megan.\n5. Lloyd George and Stevenson were soon attracted to each other.\n6. Although Stevenson, who wanted a conventional marriage and many children, hesitated about becoming the mistress of a married man, she agreed to become Lloyd George's personal secretary on his terms, which included a sexual relationship, in 1913.\n7. She was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours and accompanied Lloyd George to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919.\n8. The delegates were under the impression she was still just his secretary.\n9. Stevenson chose the location and supervised the construction of Lloyd George's house Bron- y- de in Churt, Surrey.\n10.

After having had two abortions, Stevenson gave birth to a daughter, Jennifer, in 1929.\n12. Stevenson had been having an affair with Thomas Tweed, a novelist and Liberal Party official.\n13.

Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov (9 October 195927 February 2015) was a Russian physicist and liberal politician.\n1. Nemtsov was one of the most important figures in the introduction of capitalism into the Russian post-Soviet economy.\n2. He had a successful political career in the 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin.\n3. From 2000 until his death, he was an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin.\n4. Nemtsov was assassinated on 27 February 2015, beside his Ukrainian partner Anna Duritskaya, on a bridge near the Kremlin in Moscow, with four shots fired from the back.\n5. In the weeks before his death, Nemtsov expressed fear that Putin would have him killed.\n6. In late June 2017, five Chechen men were found guilty by a jury in a Moscow court for agreeing to kill Nemtsov in exchange for 15 million rubles (US$253,000); neither the identity nor whereabouts of the person who hired them is known.\n7. Nemtsov criticized Putin's government as an increasingly authoritarian, undemocratic regime, highlighting widespread embezzlement and profiteering ahead of the Sochi Olympics, and Russian political interference and military involvement in Ukraine.\n8. After 2008, Nemtsov published in-depth reports detailing the corruption under Putin, which he connected directly with the President.\n9. As part of the same political struggle, Nemtsov was an active organizer of and participant in Dissenters' Marches, Strategy-31 civil actions and rallies \"For Fair Elections\".\n10. At the time of the assassination, Nemtsov was in Moscow helping to organize a rally against the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the Russian financial crisis.\n11. At the same time, Nemtsov was working on a report demonstrating that Russian troops were fighting alongside pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin had been denying, and was unpopular externally but also in Russia.\n12. Nemtsov was the first governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (1991–97).\n13. Later he worked in the government of Russia as Minister of Fuel and Energy (1997),\n14. Vice Premier of Russia and Security Council member from 1997 to 1998.\n15. In 1998, he founded the Young Russia movement.\n16. In 1998, he co-founded the coalition group Right Cause and in 1999, he co-formed Union of Right Forces, an electoral bloc and subsequently a political party.\n17. Nemtsov was also a member of the Congress of People's Deputies (1990), Federation Council (1993–97) and State Duma (1999–2003).\n18. He also served as Vice Speaker of the State Duma and the leader of parliamentary group Union of Right Forces.\n19. After a 2008 split in the Union of Right Forces, he co-founded Solidarnost.\n20. In 2010, he co-formed the coalition \"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\", which was refused registration as a party.\n21. Beginning in 2012, Nemtsov was co-chair of the Republican Party of Russia – People's Freedom Party (RPR-PARNAS), a registered political party.\n22. At the time of his death, Nemtsov was one of the leaders of the Solidarnost (\"Solidarity\")\n23. opposition movement, an elected member of the regional parliament of Yaroslavl Oblast, and co-chair of the RPR-PARNAS, which is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, a Pan-European political party.\n24. After Nemtsov's murder, Serge Schmemann of \"The New York Times\" paid tribute to him in an article headlined \"A Reformer Who Never Backed Down.\"\n25. Schmemann wrote: \"Tall, handsome, witty and irreverent, Mr. Nemtsov was one of the brilliant young men who burst onto the Russian stage at that exciting moment when Communist rule collapsed and a new era seemed imminent.\n26. \"\n27.

In 1571 he married his first cousin Eleonora di Garzia di Toledo, whom he accused of adultery and strangled with a dog leash in July 1576 at the Villa Medici at Cafaggiolo.\n3. He also had her supposed lover Bernardino Antinori imprisoned and killed.\n4. At the end of 1577, he went for the first of many stays at the Spanish court.\n5. He remained in Spain until the end of 1578.\n6. During this visit he gained a reputation as a spendthrift and a rake.\n7. He left Tuscany in October 1579 to bring Italian troops to Spain and lead them during the mission to Portugal.\n8.

His marriage to Dona Beatriz de Lara, daughter of Manuel de Menezes, the Portuguese Duke of Vila Real, in 1593 did little to stabilize him economically and emotionally.\n15.

Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty.\n5. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers.\n6. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash.\n7. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it.\n8.

Many slopes, natural and man-made, fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope.\n3. The deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities.\n4. For example, the modulus of deformation is reduced, and the deformation becomes plastic( i.e. non-reversible deformation on reduction of stress) rather than elastic( i.e. reversible deformation).\n5. This may cause, for example, larger settlement of foundations, which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary.\n6. Furthermore, the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass."}, {"id": "2wiki_47806bc308c411ebbd8eac1f6bf848b6_1", "title": "Mandeep Benipal", "chunk": "Title: Mandeep Benipal\n0.

Gideon Johnson Pillow (June 8, 1806 – October 8, 1878) was an American lawyer, politician, speculator, slaveowner, United States Army major general of volunteers during the Mexican–American War and Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War.\n1. Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics.\n2. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention.\n3. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican–American War, and was later promoted to major general.\n4. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec.\n5. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott.\n6. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow.\n7. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise.\n8. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party.\n9. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July.\n10. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri.\n11. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862.\n12. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner.\n13. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant.\n14. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline.\n15. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg.\n16. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war.\n17. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career.\n18. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."}, {"id": "2wiki_3e3cd62a086211ebbd5dac1f6bf848b6_3", "title": "Holm Jølsen", "chunk": "Title: Holm Jølsen\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_68cb7bc00bdd11eba7f7acde48001122_4", "title": "Motherland (disambiguation)", "chunk": "Title: Motherland (disambiguation)\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_3c68e44c0bdc11eba7f7acde48001122_5", "title": "Where Was I", "chunk": "Title: Where Was I\n0. \" Where Was I?\" may refer to:"}, {"id": "2wiki_3c68e44c0bdc11eba7f7acde48001122_6", "title": "Motherland (disambiguation)", "chunk": "Title: Motherland (disambiguation)\n0.

Catherine de' Medici (13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589), was an Italian noblewoman who was queen consort of France from 1547 until 1559, by marriage to King Henry II, and Queen mother of kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III from 1559 to 1589.\n1. The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.\n2. She was born in Florence to Lorenzo de’ Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne.\n3. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France.\n4. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle Pope Clement VII.\n5. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him.\n6. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II.\n7. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers.\n8. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as regent for her son Charles IX, King of France.\n9. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III.\n10. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).\n11. Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France.\n12. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level.\n13. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known.\n14. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement.\n15. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.\n16. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.\n17. Some historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.\n18. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars.\n19. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the Valois monarchy on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.\n20. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.\n21. According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe."}, {"id": "2wiki_94873b220bd911eba7f7acde48001122_2", "title": "Francis II of France", "chunk": "Title: Francis II of France\n0.

John Frank Dalton( March 8, 1848 August 15, 1951) was a man who, in the last few years( 1948- 1951) of his long life, publicly claimed to be the famous outlaw Jesse James.\n1. However, most professional historians believe that Dalton was merely a Jesse James impostor, and that the real Jesse James was killed by Robert\" Bob\" Ford on April 3, 1882, in a house Jesse was renting located at 1318 Lafayette Street in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n2. With the death of Jesse James in 1882, and the subsequent death of his( Dalton's) wife Julia Ellen Groshon during childbirth in 1886, Dalton abandoned his children and began roaming the countryside.\n3. In the 1930s and 1940s he appeared in Independence County, Arkansas, telling tales of being Jesse James, and on other occasions he told tales of being the famous Western lawman John Franklin\" Frank\" Dalton( June 8, 1859- November 27, 1887), thus earning himself a meal.\n4. By the 1940s he was in Oklahoma and Texas, where his uncle lived and he had relatives.\n5. It was in Texas that he first claimed he was the same Frank Dalton who historians believe had been killed in 1887.\n6. When it was proved that he was n't the original Frank Dalton( 1859- 1887), in April, 1948- in Lawton, Oklahoma- he took up being Jesse James instead.\n7. Dalton was allegedly 100 years old at the time of his first public appearance as Jesse James- at Lawton, Oklahoma in April – May, 1948.\n8. Like the real Jesse James, Dalton apparently had been a pro-Confederate guerrilla in Missouri during the Civil War.\n9. However, Dalton's account of himself as Jesse James did not hold up under questioning from Jesse James' surviving relatives.\n10. Nevertheless, several people of note, such as journalist/ novelist Robert Ruark, were convinced that J. Frank Dalton was the famous outlaw Jesse Woodson James.\n11. To many people's surprise, Dalton did appear to have many of the unique body marks/ body features which the real Jesse James was rumored to have.\n12. These body features included: seven bullet wounds, a rope burn around his neck, a collapsed lung, a damaged fingertip, and severely burned feet.\n13. On September 5, 1949, Rudi Turilli and Lester B. Dill( the general manager and owner, respectively, of Meramec Caverns, near Stanton, Missouri) hosted a reunion at Meramec Caverns for Dalton and his last- remaining old- time friends, in celebration of Dalton's/ Jesse James' supposed 102nd birthday.\n14.

Sir David Lean (25 March 190816 April 1991) was an English film director, producer, screenwriter and editor.\n1. Widely considered as one of the most influential directors of all time, Lean was mostly famous for his large-scale epics such as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965) and \"A Passage to India\" (1984).\n2. He also directed adaptations of Charles Dickens novels \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), and the romantic drama \"Brief Encounter\" (1945).\n3. Originally a film editor in the early 1930s, Lean made his directorial debut with 1942's \"In Which We Serve\", which was the first of four collaborations with Noël Coward.\n4. Beginning with \"Summertime\" in 1955, Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios; in 1970, however, the critical failure of his film \"Ryan's Daughter\" led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking, during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition.\n5. In 1984 he had a career revival with \"A Passage to India\", adapted from E. M. Forster's novel; it was an instant hit with critics but proved to be the last film Lean would direct.\n6. Lean's affinity for pictorialism and inventive editing techniques has led him to be lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott.\n7. Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute \"Sight & SoundDirectors' Top Directors\" poll in 2002.\n8. Nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director, which he won twice for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\", he has seven films in the British Film Institute's Top 100 British Films (with three of them being in the top five) and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990."}, {"id": "2wiki_ece1bdae0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_8", "title": "John Donatich", "chunk": "Title: John Donatich\n0.

The tunnel connects NCSU's North Campus with the Central Campus and provides the most direct route from The Brickyard to the Central Campus residence halls.\n3. Clubs, fraternities, sororities, and other organizations often paint the tunnel to promote events and amateur artists paint to express themselves and to promote freedom of speech.\n4. A retaining wall just outside the tunnel's south entrance is also open for free expression.\n5. The \"service tunnel\" itself was constructed in 1939 as a Public Works Administration project.\n6. The tunnel was first painted in 1968, when it was painted red and white to celebrate the military veterans of North Carolina\n7. Fans of other universities' sports teams often come to the Free Expression Tunnel before and sometimes after big athletic events to paint the tunnel with their teams' athletic colors as part of a prank.\n8. Carolina Tar Heel fans have a long history of doing this prank as well as fans from East Carolina University.\n9. The tunnel is subject to flooding during massive torrential rains.\n10. Waters rose to a height of 60 inches after a storm in July 2003.\n11. For the Spring 2005-2006 semester, the Free Expression Tunnel was closed for repairs and the installation of handicap ramps.\n12. The tunnel reopened in the winter of 2006 with a re-dedication ceremony, which unveiled a new plaque at the tunnel's north entrance expressing the brief history of the tunnel and its purpose.\n13. Prior to the renovations, the space available for free expression was much larger at both ends.\n14. On November 5, 2008 racist, threatening graffiti directed at (then) President-elect Barack Obama was found in the tunnel.\n15. Because of the threats against Obama, the Secret Service was among those called to investigate.\n16.

Zhu Di was the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming dynasty.\n3. He was originally enfeoffed as the Prince of Yan  in May 1370, with the capital of his princedom at Beiping (modern Beijing).\n4. Amid the continuing struggle against the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty, Zhu Di consolidated his own power and eliminated rivals such as the general Lan Yu.\n5. He initially accepted his father's appointment of his eldest brother Zhu Biao and then his nephew Zhu Yunwen as crown prince, but when Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor and began executing and demoting his powerful uncles, Zhu Di found pretext for rising in rebellion against his nephew.\n6. Assisted in large part by eunuchs mistreated by the Hongwu and Jianwen Emperors, who both favored the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, Zhu Di survived the initial attacks on his princedom and drove south to launch the Jingnan Campaign against the Jianwen Emperor in Nanjing.\n7. In 1402, he successfully overthrew his nephew and occupied the imperial capital, Nanjing, after which he was proclaimed Emperor and adopted the era name Yongle, which means \"perpetual happiness\".\n8. Eager to establish his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion.\n9. This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police.\n10. One favorite was Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of exploration into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n11. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital.\n12. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed the construction of the Forbidden City.\n13. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856.\n14. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment.\n15. These scholars completed the monumental \"Yongle Encyclopedia\" during his reign.\n16. The Yongle Emperor died while personally leading a military campaign against the Mongols.\n17.

The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia.\n3. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east.\n4.

The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.\n6. Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which he conquered in about 260 BCE.\n7.

Ręce do góry (known in its subtitled English version as Hands Up!) is a Polish drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski.\n1. It is the fourth of a series of semi-autobiographical films in which Skolimowski himself plays his \"alter ego\", Andrzej Leszczyc.\n2. At the time it was banned in Poland, under the Communist regime, for 18 years because it depicted the Stalinist past.\n3. The film was originally made in 1967 in monochrome by studio.\n4. In a twenty-minute section (filmed in colour) added by Skolimowski in 1981 he explains how the original was withheld by Polish censors of the time, and that this was a principal cause of\n5. his leaving his country; however following liberalisation in Poland, he was invited to resuscitate it.\n6. The introduction includes, apart from some fictional apocalyptic passages, shots of Beirut ruined by the civil wars of the 1970s, where Skolimowski is working as an actor on Volker Schloendorff's German film \"Die Fälschung (Circle of Deceit)\", and also shots of London featuring demonstrations in favour of \"Solidarnosc\", Speaker's Corner, and an exhibition of Skolimowski's own paintings.\n7. These sections include cameo roles by Bruno Ganz, David Essex, Mike Sarne and others.\n8. Some of the music in this introduction is from the 1970 choral work \"Kosmogonia\" by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki.\n9. The original film is a surrealistic reunion of Leszczyc (who has apparently become a veterinary surgeon) and some of his student colleagues.\n10. They refer to themselves by the makes of the cars they own\n11. - Leszczyc owns a Zastawa, one owns a Wartburg, the others own more upmarket models such as an Opel Rekord or the Alfa Romeo owned by the unhappily married couple.\n12. Supposedly taking speed (although it is later revealed the pills are a placebo), and carousing in the cattle truck of a freight train, the group offers various satirical sidelights on Polish society of the 1960s.\n13. The characters also reflect that the truck may have been one of those in which the former generation were transported during World War II to the Nazi death camps.\n14. The final credits show the actors as they are in 1981, with the exception of Bogumil Kobiela, who died in 1969.\n15.

Vivien Leigh , born Vivian Mary Hartley and styled as Lady Olivier after 1947 (5 November 1913 – 8 July 1967) was a British stage and film actress.\n1. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her definitive performances as Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of \"A Streetcar\n2. Named Desire\" (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949.\n3. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of \"Tovarich\" (1963).\n4. After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in \"Fire Over England\" (1937).\n5. Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress.\n6. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer.\n7. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth.\n8. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films.\n9. At the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960.\n10. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films.\n11. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life, she suffered from bipolar disorder, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53.\n12. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema."}, {"id": "2wiki_671322a00bde11eba7f7acde48001122_4", "title": "Sennedjem", "chunk": "Title: Sennedjem\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_671322a00bde11eba7f7acde48001122_6", "title": "Where Was I", "chunk": "Title: Where Was I\n0. \" Where Was I?\" may refer to:"}, {"id": "2wiki_671322a00bde11eba7f7acde48001122_7", "title": "Dance of Death (disambiguation)", "chunk": "Title: Dance of Death (disambiguation)\n0.

William Seward Burroughs II (February 5, 1914 – August 2, 1997) was an American writer and visual artist.\n1. Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature.\n2. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays.\n3. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences.\n4. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films.\n5. He was also briefly known by the pen name William Lee.\n6. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'.\n7. He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee.\n8. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties.\n9. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna.\n10. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs.\n11. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture.\n12. Much of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict, as he lived throughout Mexico City, London, Paris and the Tangier International Zone near Morocco, as well as from his travels in the South American Amazon.\n13. His work also features frequent mystical, occult or otherwise magical themes – a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life.\n14. Burroughs killed his second wife, Joan Vollmer, in 1951 in Mexico City.\n15. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a \"William Tell\" stunt.\n16. He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer.\n17. After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter \"in absentia\", and received a two-year suspended sentence.\n18. Burroughs found success with his confessional first novel, \"Junkie\" (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel \"Naked Lunch\" (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. sodomy laws.\n19. With Brion Gysin, he also popularized the literary cut-up technique in works such as The Nova Trilogy (1961–1964).\n20. In 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France.\n21. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift\", a reputation he owes to his \"lifelong subversion\" of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism.\n22. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War\", while Norman Mailer declared him \"the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius\".\n23. Burroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator Brion Gysin.\n24. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide.\n25. Burroughs had one child, William S. Burroughs Jr. (1947–1981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer.\n26.

Caligula (31 August 12 – 24 January 41 AD) was Roman emperor from 37 to 41 AD.\n1. The son of the popular Roman general Germanicus and Augustus's granddaughter Agrippina the Elder, Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n2. Germanicus's uncle and adoptive father, Tiberius, succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in 14 AD.\n3. Although he was born Gaius Caesar, after Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (\n4. meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\", the diminutive form of \"caliga\") from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania.\n5. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius.\n6. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor.\n7. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of Capri, where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier.\n8. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37.\n9. There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule.\n10. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant.\n11. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate.\n12. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus.\n13. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province.\n14. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers.\n15. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however.\n16. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next Roman emperor.\n17. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of his nephew Nero in 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line."}, {"id": "2wiki_1734c9b60baf11ebab90acde48001122_1", "title": "Eldon Howard", "chunk": "Title: Eldon Howard\n0.

Charles II (29 May 1630 – 6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\n1. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death.\n2. Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France.\n3. After Charles I's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649.\n4. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a \"de facto\" republic led by Oliver Cromwell.\n5. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe.\n6. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n7. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands.\n8. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain.\n9. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim.\n10. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.\n11. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England.\n12. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance.\n13. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War.\n14. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France.\n15. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date.\n16. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it.\n17. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic.\n18. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties.\n19. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile.\n20. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685.\n21. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed.\n22. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the \"Merry Monarch\", in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans.\n23. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses.\n24.

That summer, he served as a volunteer on the side of the French at the Siege of Luxembourg.\n7. In 1687, Northumberland commanded the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards.\n8.

Soon after the marriage, Northumberland and his brother, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, allegedly attempted to privately convey her abroad to an English convent in Ghent, Belgium.\n16. After the death of Catherine in 1714, Northumberland remarried to Mary Dutton, the sister of Captain Mark Dutton.\n17.

Henry III (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.\n1. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War.\n2. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217.\n3. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.\n4. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war.\n5. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle.\n6. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.\n7. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers.\n8. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles.\n9. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children.\n10. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint.\n11. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community.\n12. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg.\n13. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n14. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money.\n15. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony.\n16. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts.\n17. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford.\n18. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony.\n19. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n20. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War.\n21. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army.\n22. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner.\n23. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father.\n24. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth.\n25. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support.\n26. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor.\n27. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290.\n28.

Edward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots , was King of England from 1272 to 1307.\n1. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward.\n2. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons.\n3. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford.\n4. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War.\n5. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265.\n6. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land.\n7. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died.\n8. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August.\n9. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.\n10. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law.\n11. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs.\n12. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest.\n13. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people.\n14. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland.\n15. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom.\n16. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points.\n17. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England.\n18. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland.\n19. At the same time there were problems at home.\n20. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition.\n21. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled.\n22. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.\n23. Edward\n24. I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\".\n25. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries.\n26. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith.\n27. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward\n28. I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility.\n29. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes.\n30. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England.\n31. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657."}], "supporting_facts": [{"id": "2wiki_sf_ddacf7580baf11ebab90acde48001122_0", "title": "Edward I of England", "chunk": "The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons."}, {"id": "2wiki_sf_ddacf7580baf11ebab90acde48001122_1", "title": "Henry III of England", "chunk": "He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children."}], "evidences": [{"subject": "Edward I of England", "relation": "father", "object": "Henry III"}, {"subject": "Henry III", "relation": "spouse", "object": "Eleanor of Provence"}], "decomposition": []}

Children Underground is an American 2001 documentary film directed by Edet Belzberg.\n1. In an effort to increase the Romanian work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966.\n2. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions.\n3. With the fall of Communism, many children from the orphanages moved into the streets while others were runaways from impoverished families.\n4. Today there are 20,000 children living in the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited.\n5. \" Children Underground\" follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania.\n6. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with.\n7. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags.\n8. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police who swept off the Victoriei has dispersed the children.\n9. Some of them landed in state- funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city.\n10. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough.\n11. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants in the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate.\n12. One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu.\n13. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive.\n14. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta' Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl.\n15. The nickname' Macarena' derives from the song\" Macarena\", her favorite.\n16. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled.\n17. The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac.\n18. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constanța.\n19.

But his views on slavery changed dramatically; he came to see it as \"not a moral evil\", but \"an ordinance of...God\", which \"providentially found a settlement in this country\".\n6. These views and his opposition to the Civil War, which he blamed on abolitionists,brought a storm of controversy, earning him the enmity of several members of the Dartmouth Board of Trustees, including Amos Tuck (1835), a founding member of the Republican Party and close friend of Abraham Lincoln.\n7. Matters came to a head in 1863 when the Trustees were deadlocked on awarding an honorary degree to President Lincoln, and Lord broke the tie by voting against it.\n8.

His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement.\n2. Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest.\n3. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985).\n4. His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics.\n5. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations.\n6. In 2003, Van Sant's film about the Columbine High School massacre, \"Elephant\", won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n7. Van Sant also received the festival's Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being Joel Coen—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year.\n8. Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as \"Finding Forrester\" (2000) and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007), some of his efforts, such as the art house production \"Last Days\" (2005) and the environmental drama \"Promised Land\" (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his adaptation of Tom Robbins's \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" (1994), his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and \"The Sea of Trees\" (2015), were critical and commercial failures.\n9. In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled \"Pink\".\n10. A book of his photography, called \"108 Portraits\", has also been published, and he has released two musical albums.\n11.

My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's\" Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2\", and\" Henry V\", and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves.\n1. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother.\n2. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own.\n3. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays.\n4. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids.\n5. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.\n6. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\".\n7. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million.\n8. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.\n9. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking.\n10. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences.\n11.

The Catheters were a punk rock band from Bellevue, Washington, which formed in 1995 as a 4- piece with singer Brian Standeford, guitarist Derek Mason, bassist Paul Waude, and drummer James Lysons( who was soon replaced by Davey Borozowski of the band Damaged Goods).\n1. They originally played hardcore punk in the vein of bands such as Black Flag and The Circle Jerks.\n2. In 1998 they added second guitarist Lars Swenson and began cultivating a dirtier' 70s glam- rock sound, as heard on their eMpTy Records releases.\n3. The records sold fairly well and gained them the attention of larger labels such as DreamWorks and Sub Pop, the latter of whom signed the band to a recording contract in 1999.\n4. Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils.\n5. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4- piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist.\n6. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song\" Nothing\", from their album\" Static Delusions and Stone- Still Days\"( Sub Pop, 2002).\n7. After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album\" Howling ... It Grows and Grows !!!\"\n8. ( Sub Pop, 2004), which infused their earlier sound with elements of classic rock.\n9. The Catheters played their final show on October 15, 2004 at Seattle's Sunset Tavern, joined by friends the Vells and blackbelt( who played some old- school Catheters covers), ending the show with a mass sing- along to their song'\" Fake ID\" which degenerated into instrument destruction and a minor brawl.\n10. The band dissolved amicably, with Brian Standeford and Davey Borozowski forming the group Tall Birds( later joined by Leo Gebhardt), while Derek Mason went on to play keyboards in the Girls and bass in Sunday Night Blackout.\n11. After Tall Birds disbanded, Standeford started Idle Times, while Borozowski went on to form the band Black Whales.\n12. Borozowski also tours with the popular indy rock band Modest Mouse as their percussionist/ second drummer, alongside Jeremiah Green.\n13. Idle times has released two seven- inches, and Black Whales have an EP on Mt Fuji Records and a self- released full- length album.\n14. Mason's band the Girls are on Dirtnap Records.\n15.

As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy.\n5. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms.\n6. This turned around in his late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and wastefulness in his court and a stagnating civil society.\n7. A British valet who accompanied his diplomat master to the Qing court in 1793 described the emperor:\n8. The Emperor is about five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but elegant form; his complexion is comparatively fair, though his eyes are dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age he is said to have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the prince, evinces the amiable character of the man.\n9. His dress consisted of a loose robe of yellow silk, a cap of black velvet with a red ball on the top, and adorned with a peacock's feather, which is the peculiar distinction of mandarins of the first class.\n10. He wore silk boots embroidered with gold, and a sash of blue girded his waist."}, {"id": "2wiki_d4a23f020bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_5", "title": "Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui", "chunk": "Title: Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui\n0.

He was sent by his father to Gaul with a powerful army, accompanied by three generals — Thorisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus — in order to oppose the Visigoths then occupying Provence and threatening to conquer the Auvergne.\n4. He and his generals were defeated by the Visigothic king Euric near Arles and all four of them lost their lives.\n5. The \"Chronica\", in entry 649, states:\n6.

It can probably be further narrowed to the period when Anthemius is known to have been organising a concerted effort to remove the Visigoths from Gaul between 468 and 471, a period during which an army led by the Briton Riothamus was defeated near Déols.\n13.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_bb8e4d040bda11eba7f7acde48001122_9", "title": "Beaulieu-sur-Loire", "chunk": "Title: Beaulieu-sur-Loire\n0.

Alexander, also known by his Roman name Gaius Julius Alexander( 15 BC- probably between 26- 28 AD) was a Herodian Prince.\n1. Alexander was the second born son of Alexander and Glaphyra.\n2. His oldest brother was called Tigranes and had a younger unnamed sister.\n3. His father Alexander was a Judean Prince, of Jewish, Nabataean and Edomite descent and was a son of King of Judea, Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne.\n4. His mother Glaphyra was a Cappadocian Princess, who was of Greek, Armenian and Persian descent.\n5. She was the daughter of the King Archelaus of Cappadocia and her mother was an unnamed Princess from Armenia, possibly a relation of the Artaxiad Dynasty.\n6. Alexander was the namesake of his father.\n7. His name reflects his Hasmonean and Hellenic lineage.\n8. Alexander was born and raised in Herod's court in Jerusalem.\n9. After the death and burial of his father in 7 BC, Herod acted in an extreme and brutal manner returning his mother to Cappadocia, forcing her to leave her children under the sole custody of Herod in Jerusalem.\n10. Alexander and his brother remained under Herod's guardianship so he could be able to control their fates.\n11. Another son of Herod's Antipater, was concerned for Alexander and his brother as he expected them to attain higher station than their own late fathers, because of the assistance Antipater considered likely from their maternal grandfather Archelaus.\n12. In the time Alexander lived in Herod's court, he was betrothed to the daughter of Pheroras.\n13. Pheroras was Alexander's paternal great- uncle and was Herod's brother.\n14. Antipater persuaded Herod to call off Alexander's betrothal to Pheroras ’ daughter because Antipater convinced his father that closer ties between Pheroras and Archelaus of Cappadocia were liable to develop into a plot against Herod.\n15. Herod died in 4 BC in Jericho.\n16. After the death of Herod, Alexander and his brother decided to leave Jerusalem and to live with their mother and her family in the Cappadocian Royal Court.\n17. After Alexander and his brother arrived in Cappadocia, they disavowed their Jewish descent, deserted their Jewish religion and embraced their Greek descent, including the religion.\n18. However the family connections to the Herodian Dynasty were n't wholly broken.\n19. After Alexander and his brother disavowed their Jewish descent, they were considered among fellow Jews as gentiles.\n20. There is a possibility that his maternal grandfather sent Alexander to be educated in Rome.\n21. Little is known of the adult life of Alexander.\n22. He appeared to an administrator for the extensive land estates in Egypt that were owned by the Imperial family of Rome and he was a wealthy landowner, owing two estates in the Egyptian town of Euhemeria.\n23. Alexander married an unnamed noblewoman who flourished in the reigns of the first two Roman Emperors Augustus and Tiberius.\n24. His wife bore him a son called Tigranes.\n25. Alexander named his son in honor of his brother.\n26. Tigranes later served as a Roman Client King of Armenia under the reign of Roman Emperor Nero( reigned 54- 68).\n27.

Anil Krishna Biswas (अनिल कृष्ण विश्वास / অনিল বিশ্বাস; 7 July 1914 – 31 May 2003) was an noted Indian film music director and playback singer from 1935 to 1965, who apart from being one of pioneers of playback singing, is also credited for the first Indian orchestra of twelve pieces and introducing orchestral music and full-blooded choral effects, into Indian cinema.\n1. A master in western symphonic music was known for the Indian classical or folk elements, especially Baul and Bhatiyali in his music.\n2. Out of his over 90 films, most memorable were, \"Roti\" (1942), \"Kismet\" (1943), \"Anokha Pyaar\" (1948), \"Taraana\" (1951), \"Waaris\" (1954), \"Pardesi\" (1957) and \"Char Dil Char Rahen\" (1959).\n3.

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain.\n2. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court.\n3. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n4. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted.\n5. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain.\n6. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome.\n7. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain.\n8. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca.\n9. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy.\n10. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son.\n11. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I.\n12. He had little interest in ruling.\n13. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe.\n14. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life.\n15. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna.\n16. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief.\n17. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution.\n18. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849.\n19. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860.\n20. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca.\n21.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_3641d5c60bda11eba7f7acde48001122_1", "title": "Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia", "chunk": "Title: Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_d6be0cee0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_7", "title": "Beaulieu-sur-Loire", "chunk": "Title: Beaulieu-sur-Loire\n0.

Akhenaten (also spelled Echnaton, Akhenaton, Ikhnaton, and Khuenaten; meaning \"Effective for Aten\"), known before the fifth year of his reign as Amenhotep IV\n1. (sometimes given its Greek form, \"Amenophis IV\", and meaning \"Amun Is Satisfied\"), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, who ruled for 17 years and died perhaps in 1336 BC or 1334 BC.\n2. He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten (notably instead of Amun the temples of which he destroyed, the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources), which is sometimes described as monolatristic, henotheistic, or even quasi-monotheistic.\n3. An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars, and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god, giving the solar deity a status above mere gods.\n4. Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt's traditional religion, but the shifts were not widely accepted.\n5. After his death, his monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from the king lists.\n6. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as \"the enemy\" or \"that criminal\" in archival records.\n7. The stele of Merneptah, on the one hand, values Amun who is represented giving the cemetery of victory to Ramses III (Merneptah), on the other hand, is written on the back of a stele of Akhenaten stolen from one of his temples in Karnak.\n8. He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at Amarna.\n9. Early excavations at Amarna by Flinders\n10. Petrie sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh, and a mummy found in the tomb KV55, which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by Edward R. Ayrton, is likely that of Akhenaten.\n11. DNA analysis has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King Tutankhamun, but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned.\n12. Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti comes partly from his connection with Tutankhamun (even though Tutankhamun's mother was not Nefertiti, but a woman named by archaeologists The Younger Lady), partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and partly from ongoing interest in the religion he attempted to establish."}, {"id": "2wiki_d6be0cee0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_9", "title": "Where Was I", "chunk": "Title: Where Was I\n0. \" Where Was I?\" may refer to:"}], "supporting_facts": [{"id": "2wiki_sf_d6be0cee0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_0", "title": "Meritaten", "chunk": "Her name means \"She who is beloved of Aten\"; Aten being the sun-deity whom her father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, worshipped."}, {"id": "2wiki_sf_d6be0cee0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_1", "title": "Akhenaten", "chunk": "He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at Amarna."}], "evidences": [{"subject": "Meritaten", "relation": "father", "object": "Akhenaten"}, {"subject": "Akhenaten", "relation": "place of death", "object": "Akhetaten"}], "decomposition": []}

Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward.\n2. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons.\n3. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford.\n4. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War.\n5. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265.\n6. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land.\n7. Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died.\n8. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 19 August.\n9. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.\n10. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law.\n11. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs.\n12. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest.\n13. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people.\n14. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland.\n15. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom.\n16. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points.\n17. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after the French king Philip IV had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England.\n18. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland.\n19. At the same time there were problems at home.\n20. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition.\n21. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled.\n22. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.\n23. Edward\n24. I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\".\n25. He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries.\n26. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith.\n27. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward\n28. I: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility.\n29. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes.\n30. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England.\n31. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657."}, {"id": "2wiki_4aa187080baf11ebab90acde48001122_5", "title": "Hubba bint Hulail", "chunk": "Title: Hubba bint Hulail\n0.

Henry III (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.\n1. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War.\n2. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217.\n3. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.\n4. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war.\n5. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle.\n6. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.\n7. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers.\n8. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles.\n9. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children.\n10. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint.\n11. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community.\n12. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg.\n13. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n14. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money.\n15. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony.\n16. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts.\n17. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford.\n18. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony.\n19. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n20. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War.\n21. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army.\n22. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner.\n23. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father.\n24. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth.\n25. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support.\n26. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor.\n27. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290.\n28. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised."}, {"id": "2wiki_4aa187080baf11ebab90acde48001122_8", "title": "Edward Despenser (died 1342)", "chunk": "Title: Edward Despenser (died 1342)\n0.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman.\n1. His works include: four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour.\n2. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived.\n3. A literary celebrity by the age of 25\n4. , Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782 after taking up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (1774).\n5. He was an early participant in the \"Sturm und Drang\" literary movement.\n6. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena.\n7. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace.\n8. Goethe's first major scientific work, the \"Metamorphosis of Plants\", was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy.\n9. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805.\n10. During this period Goethe published his second novel, \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\"; the verse epic \"Hermann and Dorothea\", and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, \"Faust\".\n11. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\n12. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" one of the four greatest novels ever written, while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare).\n13. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably Johann Peter Eckermann's \"Conversations with Goethe\" (1836)."}, {"id": "2wiki_04b5e0320bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_3", "title": "Jan Harlan", "chunk": "Title: Jan Harlan\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_04b5e0320bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_5", "title": "Where Was I", "chunk": "Title: Where Was I\n0. \" Where Was I?\" may refer to:"}, {"id": "2wiki_04b5e0320bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_6", "title": "Christia Sylf", "chunk": "Title: Christia Sylf\n0.

For thirty years he served the interests of the Dukes of Guelders in their struggle to safeguard the independence of the Duchy of Guelders against the Habsburg Netherlands of Charles V. Van Rossum had a number of military successes obtained through his use of ruses, daring and the indiscriminate destruction of civilian lives and property.\n5.

Although the Emperor Sigismund had invested the Duke of Berg with the duchy of Gelders, Arnold retained the confidence of the Estates by enlarging their privileges, and enjoyed the support of Duke Philip of Burgundy.\n5. Arnold was betrothed, and afterwards united in marriage to Catherine of Cleves, a niece of Philip of Burgundy.\n6. Subsequently, however, Duke Arnold fell out with his ally as to the succession to the see of Utrecht, whereupon Philip joined with the four chief towns of Guelders in the successful attempt of Arnold's son Adolf to substitute his own for his father's authority.\n7.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_1efc66b60bde11eba7f7acde48001122_9", "title": "Girolamo Riario", "chunk": "Title: Girolamo Riario\n0.

Herman Friedrich Graebe or Gräbe,( June 19, 1900 – April 17, 1986) was a German manager and engineer in charge of a German building firm in Ukraine, who witnessed mass executions of the Jews of Dubno on October 5, 1942 by Nazis.\n1. Following the war he wrote a famous and horrifying testimony.\n2. Graebe gave the following eyewitness account:\n3. My foreman and I went directly to the pits.\n4. Nobody bothered us.\n5. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds.\n6. The people who had got off the trucks- men, women and children of all ages- had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip.\n7. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments.\n8. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under -linen and clothing.\n9. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand.\n10. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy.\n11. I watched a family of about eight persons, a man and a woman both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty- four, and two grown- up daughters about twenty- eight or twenty- nine.\n12. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one- year- old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it.\n13. The child was cooing with delight.\n14. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes.\n15. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears.\n16. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him.\n17. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade.\n18. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound.\n19. Among them was the family I have just mentioned.\n20. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said,\" twenty- three years old.\"\n21. I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave.\n22. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible.\n23. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads.\n24. Some of the people shot were still moving.\n25. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive.\n26. The pit was nearly two- thirds full.\n27. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people.\n28. I looked for the man who did the shooting.\n29. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit.\n30. He had a tommy- gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette.\n31. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them.\n32. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice.\n33. Then I heard a series of shots.\n34. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them.\n35. Blood was running from their necks.\n36. The next batch was approaching already.\n37. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot.\n38. He later provided vital testimony in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, invoking bitter persecution from many of his countrymen.\n39. To escape the hostility, Graebe moved his family to San Francisco in 1948, where he lived until his death in 1986.\n40. Hermann Graebe was honoured as a' Righteous Among the Nations' by Yad Vashem.\n41. Another witness of the mass executions of October 1942 in Dubno was the German officer Axel von dem Bussche who, traumatised by what he had seen, in 1943 joined the German resistance around Claus von Stauffenberg and unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in a suicide attack in November 1943."}, {"id": "2wiki_1b91365c08a311ebbd7bac1f6bf848b6_3", "title": "Louis-René des Forêts", "chunk": "Title: Louis-René des Forêts\n0.

They were sons of architect William Adam.\n2. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth.\n3. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses.\n4. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles.\n5. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs.\n6. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London.\n7. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781).\n8. From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire.\n9. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794).\n10. He also designed Portland Place in central London.\n11. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794.\n12. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822)."}, {"id": "2wiki_eeb017fa0bdd11eba7f7acde48001122_5", "title": "James Adam (classicist)", "chunk": "Title: James Adam (classicist)\n0.

The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe.\n4. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936.\n5. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona.\n6. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies.\n7. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas.\n8.

Miss Seventeen is a reality television show on MTV that aired from October 17, 2005 to December 19, 2005.\n1. The show consisted of 17 young women competing for an internship at and a college scholarship.\n2. Atoosa Rubenstein was the main judge, she was the youngest editor-in-chief ever to run \"Seventeen magazine\".\n3. They picked 17 girls from around the United States who were not only photogenic but also had been at the top of their class, to provide a role model for young women.\n4. The girls were flown to New York, where they would take part in a contest similar in format to The Apprentice — they would be given tasks to be done by Atoosa, and in each episode one of the girls would be eliminated from the competition.\n5. The winner would get her face on the cover of \"Seventeen magazine\", a college scholarship and would be offered an internship job on the magazine.\n6. The criteria for elimination were not only performing poorly — Atoosa was watchful of how the girls talked when no one else was in the room, via cameras set up around the house.\n7. In this manner, she could watch the girls with their guards down and see what their real motivations and dreams were.\n8. In one elimination, for example, Atoosa sat down with the girl and explained that she didn't feel that the girl was in the contest for the 'right' reasons — video clips were shown to the viewers which showed the girl talking to her other roommates and explaining that she was more interested in the face-time she would get for being part of an MTV show.\n9. Where the format differed from other shows was in the first elimination round and in how the contestants found out who was eliminated.\n10. In the first episode, all 17 girls sat around the dinner table with Atoosa and had to describe in brief who they were and what they hoped they would get out of the experience.\n11. Based on this conversation, Atoosa eliminated 7 of the girls from the contest.\n12. The way the girls would generally find out who was eliminated was by sitting around a TV as Atoosa would talk to them, telling them the results of the tasks they were given.\n13. The TV screen would then display the names of the girls who would be staying in the house, written in cursive form.\n14. The girl whose name didn't appear on 'The List' was eliminated, and met with Atoosa to hear her reasoning for why she was eliminated.\n15. In the final episode, Jennifer Steele was declared the winner, with her magazine cover unveiled in Times Square.\n16. It was also revealed that Brianne Burrowes, who voluntarily left the show in an early episode of the series, was offered a job by Atoosa and will be working with Jennifer in their respective internships at the magazine."}, {"id": "2wiki_077b294e0bdb11eba7f7acde48001122_8", "title": "Ted Key", "chunk": "Title: Ted Key\n0.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_bac99ab40bd911eba7f7acde48001122_6", "title": "William Rockhill Nelson", "chunk": "Title: William Rockhill Nelson\n0.

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent.\n3. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age.\n4. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio.\n5. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations.\n6. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz's direction.\n7. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis.\n8. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\".\n9. Curtiz introduced to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles.\n10. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic.\n11. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the \"human and fundamental problems of real people\" were the basis of all good drama.\n12. Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as \"Captain Blood\" (1935) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938).\n13. He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), \"The Sea Wolf\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945).\n14. He directed leading musicals, including \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), \"\n15.

This Land Is Your Land\", has inspired several generations both politically and musically.\n2. He wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works.\n3. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", is included on \"Mojo\" magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World.\n4.

Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah, Oklahoma, until he was 14, when his mother Mary was hospitalized as a consequence of Huntington's disease, a fatal hereditary neurological disorder.\n8. His father moved to Pampa, Texas, to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals.\n9. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends.\n10. He married at 19, but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for employment.\n11. He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD, achieving some fame from playing hillbilly music; made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck; and wrote a column for the communist newspaper \"People's World\" from May 1939 to January 1940.\n12. Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, although he did not appear to belong to any.\n13. With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings.\n14. He left the station, ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\".\n15. In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song, \"\n16. This Land Is Your Land\".\n17.

In 1299, while still a child, she had been married to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens.\n3. Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long- extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica.\n4. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses.\n5. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother.\n6. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto.\n7. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis.\n8. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto.\n9. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut.\n10.

However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23- year- old in charge of the Morea.\n14. It was soon disputed by the varying claimants and Matilda was solidly dispossessed of her fief by 1318, in which year John, Duke of Durazzo, an Angevin, abducted the princess and forced her to marry him.\n15.

For his early innovations as a director, Stroheim is still celebrated as one of the first of the auteur directors.\n4. He helped introduce more sophisticated plots and noirish sexual and psychological undercurrents into cinema.\n5. He died in 1957 in France of prostate cancer at the age of 71.\n6.

Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 19028 March 1983) was an English composer.\n1. During a 60 year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera.\n2. His best-known works include \"Façade\", the cantata \"Belshazzar's Feast\", the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems \"Crown Imperial\" and \"Orb and Sceptre\".\n3. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford.\n4. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education.\n5. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, \"Façade\", which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.\n6. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia.\n7. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned.\n8. His only full-length opera, \"Troilus and Cressida\", was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses.\n9. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.\n10. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large.\n11.

The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.\n1. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.\n2. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.\n3. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live.\n4. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth.\n5. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n6. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents.\n7. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947.\n8. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.\n9. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\n10. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively).\n11. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin.\n12. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent.\n13. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth.\n14. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\".\n15. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\").\n16. There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.\n17. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\n18. Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\".\n19. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".\n20. For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}, {"id": "2wiki_a703e1160bdd11eba7f7acde48001122_1", "title": "Ginevra d'Este", "chunk": "Title: Ginevra d'Este\n0.

During the king's difficulties with the barons, when they sought for the French prince to assume the English throne, William is listed as one of those who advised John to accede to\" Magna Carta\".\n10. His allegiance only faltered a few times when the king's cause looked hopeless; shortly before the death of John, he made terms with Prince Louis.\n11. In March 1217 he again demonstrated his loyalty to England by supporting the young King Henry III, and he was also responsible for the establishment of Salisbury Cathedral.\n12. However, he disliked the royal favourites who came into power after 1227, and used his influence to protect Hubert de Burgh when the latter had been removed from office by their efforts in 1232.\n13. Warenne's relations with the king became strained in course of time.\n14. In 1238 he was evidently regarded as a leader of the baronial opposition, for the Great Council appointed him as one of the treasurers who were to prevent the king from squandering the subsidy voted in that year.\n15. William married Maud Marshal, on 13 October 1225.\n16. They had a son and a daughter.\n17. The son John( 1231–1304) succeeded his father as earl, while the daughter, Isabel de Warenne( c. 1228–1282), married Hugh d' Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel.\n18.

Fra' Emmanuel Marie des Neiges de Rohan- Polduc( 18 April 1725, in la Mancha, Spain – 14 July 1797, in Valletta, Malta) was a member of the wealthy and influential Rohan family of France, and 70th Prince and Grand Master of the Order of St. John from 1775 to 1797.\n1. De Rohan was born in la Mancha, Spain on 18 April 1725.\n2. His father was French, but had been banished to Spain.\n3. He served in the courts of Madrid and Parma, before becoming an ambassador to Francis I.\n4. He eventually joined the Order of St. John, and served in several posts.\n5. He was considered as a potential successor to Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca following his death in 1773, but Francisco Ximenes de Texada was elected instead.\n6. Ximenes' magistracy was unpopular due to the Order's bankruptcy.\n7. He died in 1775, and was succeeded by De Rohan.\n8. De Rohan sought to win the respect of the people, and he became a popular Grand Master.\n9. On 21 June 1777, he elevated the village of Żebbuġ to the status of city, naming it Città Rohan.\n10. An archway commemorating this event was constructed in 1798.\n11. The coat of arms of Żebbuġ contains the arms of the House of Rohan, in honour of the Grand Master.\n12. De Rohan authored the\" Code de Rohan\", a constitutional law book published in two volumes titled\" Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes of Malta\" in 1782.\n13. This Grand Master was also responsible for the publication of the Diritto Municipale in 1784.\n14. De Rohan instituted the Anglo- Bavarian langue, which was housed in the former Palazzo Carniero.\n15. In 1797, he established the Russian Grand Priory, which later evolved into the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller.\n16. In 1792, he commissioned and partially financed the construction of Fort Tigné.\n17. St. Lucian Tower& Battery were also upgraded during De Rohan's magistracy, and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan in 1795 after the Grand Master.\n18. It was rebuilt as Fort San Lucian in the 1870s, but it still retains De Rohan's coat of arms on the façade.\n19. The last few years of De Rohan's magistracy were troublesome, due to the decline of the Order because of the French Revolution.\n20. De Rohan suffered a stroke in 1792, and his health began to deteriorate.\n21. He died on 14 July 1797, and was buried at St. John's Co- Cathedral in Valletta.\n22. His last words were\" I, at any rate, am the last grandmaster, at least of an order illustrious and independent.\"\n23. He was proven correct, since less than a year after his death, the French invaded Malta and expelled the Order from the island."}, {"id": "2wiki_4f0d28fb088b11ebbd6fac1f6bf848b6_3", "title": "António Eduardo Pereira dos Santos", "chunk": "Title: António Eduardo Pereira dos Santos\n0.

Gjergj Kastrioti (6 May 1405 – 17 January 1468), known as Skanderbeg (or \"Skënderbeu\" from), was an Albanian nobleman and military commander who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.\n1. A member of the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent to the Ottoman court as hostage, where he was educated and entered the service of the Ottoman sultan for the next twenty years.\n2. He rose through the ranks, culminating in the appointment as \"sanjakbey\" (governor) of the Sanjak of Dibra in 1440.\n3. In 1443, he deserted the Ottomans during the Battle of Niš and became the ruler of Krujë, Svetigrad, and Modrič.\n4. In 1444, he was appointed the chief commander of the short-lived League of Lezhë that consolidated nobility throughout what is today Northern Albania.\n5. Thus, for the first time Albania was united under a single leader.\n6. Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians, because he did not gain support in the Venetian-controlled north or in the Ottoman-controlled south.\n7. His followers included, apart from Albanians, also Slavs, Vlachs, and Greeks.\n8. Despite this military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in nowadays northern Albania where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place.\n9. His rebellion was a national rebellion.\n10. The resistance led by him brought Albanians of different regions and dialects together in a common cause, helping define the ethnic identity of the Albanians.\n11. Skanderbeg's military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and he was considered by many in western Europe to be a model of Christian resistance against Muslims.\n12. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000 man army marched through Ottoman territory winning against consistently larger and better supplied Ottoman forces, for which he was admired.\n13. Skanderbeg always signed himself in (\"Lord of Albania\"), and claimed no other titles but that in documents.\n14. In 1451, he recognized \"de jure\" the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples over Albania through the Treaty of Gaeta, to ensure a protective alliance, although he remained a \"de facto\" independent ruler.\n15. In 1460–61, he participated in Italy's civil wars in support of Ferdinand I of Naples.\n16. In 1463, he became the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering.\n17. Together with Venetians he fought against the Ottomans during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) until his death in January 1468.\n18. He ranks high in that military history, as the most persistent opponent of the Ottoman Empire in its heyday who was also ever-victorious."}, {"id": "2wiki_ae741c140bdc11eba7f7acde48001122_4", "title": "Jerina Branković (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)", "chunk": "Title: Jerina Branković (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)\n0.
