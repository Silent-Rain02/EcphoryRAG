She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America.  In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era.  She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace.  In her essay “Utilization of Women in City Government,” Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women’s roles in the private sphere.  Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions.  She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively.  Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.  She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman \"public philosopher in the history of the United States.  In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU.

The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.  Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues.  Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean.  During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics.

However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol.  Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs.

Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine.  The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method.

The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle.

The Royal Navy realised that airships similar to Ferdinand von Zeppelin's designs could be of great use and in 1909 ordered construction of a rigid airship.  This was completed in 1911 but was wrecked while leaving the hangar before it had flown.  Meanwhile, the British Army's School of Ballooning, later the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, acquired a small fleet of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships for observation purposes; they were taken over by the Royal Navy on the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914.  A large number of rigid and non-rigid airships were mainly used to counter the U-Boat campaign in World War I.

About 30,000 people disappeared, many of which were impossible to be formally reported due to the nature of the issue: state terrorism.  The targets were left-wing activists, guerrillas and militants, trade unionists, students, journalists and Marxists and Peronist guerrillas and their support network in the Montoneros believed to be 150,000-250,000-strong and 60,000-strong in the ERP, as well as alleged sympathizers.  Some 10,000 of the \"disappeared\" were guerrillas of the Montoneros (MPM) and the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) although the lowest estimate is that the Montoneros and ERP had a combined strength of 5,000.  The \"disappeared\" included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta, even vaguely, and they were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas.  The worst repression reportedly occurred after the guerillas were largely defeated in 1977, when the church, labor unions, artists, intellectuals and university students and professors were targeted.  Although the Montoneros reported having carried out some 600 armed attacks in 1977, the guerrilla threat had greatly declined.  The junta justified this mass terror by exaggerating the guerrilla threat, and even staged attacks to be blamed on guerillas and used frozen dead bodies of guerilla fighters that had been kept in storage for this purpose.  In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup.  That year, a special study by the New York City Bar concluded that around 10,000 Argentines had disappeared since the coup.

Through the years between 1993 and 1995, the band writes and records the self-titled EP which was released through Malicious Records and contains only two songs - \"Det hviskes blant sorte vinder\" which means \"It Is Whispered Amid the Black Winds\" in Norwegian and \"Nattevandring\" which means \"Nightwandering\" in Norwegian.  The music style and sound of this demo is more ambient/atmospheric black metal oriented.  Mainly because of this release, the band is commonly recognised as the creators of depressive black metal along with some other bands from the second wave of black metal music.  At this time the band line up contains: Ravn Harjar - on guitars, Storm - on bass and vocals and Jardar - on drums.  After the releasing of the self-titled EP, there was no any official releases by the band.  There are also bootleg releases that came out through the years like the CD from 2005 by Ars Mysteriorum and LP, each featuring both \"End of Life\" and the self - titled EP tracks.  In the year of 2001 the original former member of \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\", bass player and vocalist - Storm committed suicide.  In the year of 2007, the Greek label Kyrck Productions & Armour re-released all the previous material released by the band from the past which contains all \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\" material.  Somewhere between 2009 and 2010 there was a reunion of the band with old members including Vicotnik (Dødheimsgard, ex-Aphrodisiac, ex-Ved Buens Ende, ex-Manes, ex-Code, ex-Naer Mataron, ex-Endwarfment).  Another member that was part of the reunion was Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm - the main composer of the \"End of Life\" track.  In 2014 Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm died.  At this time the band line up contains Ravn Harjar - on guitars and vocals, Vicotnik - on bass and Sigmund (ex-Inflabitan, ex-Dødheimsgard) - on guitars.  In January 2015, Ravn Harjar wrote a statement on the official Strid Facebook page that in the autumn of the year 2015 the band will start recording their first full-length album which will be titled \"Endetid\".  That means \"End of times\" in Norwegian."}, {"id": "5ac141dd5542991316484a9b_ctxchunk_2", "title": "Daniel McConnell (footballer)", "chunk": "Daniel McConnell (footballer): Daniel McConnell (born 21 June 1986) is a former member of the West Coast Eagles Australian Football League club.

Art games are \"interactive\" (usually \"competitive\" against the computer, self, or other players) and the result of \"artistic intent\" by the party offering the piece for consideration.  They also typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design.  The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling.  Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"video game art\"."}, {"id": "5adc89435542994d58a2f639_ctxchunk_5", "title": "Garry Schyman", "chunk": "Garry Schyman: Garry Schyman (born 1954) is an American film, television, and video game music composer.

At the request of a friend in 1993, he composed the music for the video game \"Voyeur\", but after creating the music for two more games he left the industry, citing the low budgets and poor quality of video game music at the time.  He continued to compose for film and television, only to return to video games for 2005's \"Destroy All Humans! \".  Finding that in his absence the quality and perceived importance of video game music had risen substantially, he has since composed for several games, writing the scores to \"BioShock\" and \"Dante's Inferno\" among others.

SAR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved.  Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures.  This recognition triggers an immune response.  The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000).  Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors.  These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins.  SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed.  SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called \"broad spectrum.\"  SAR is associated with the induction of a wide range of genes (so called PR or \"pathogenesis-related\" genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA).  The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a molecular signal transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called \"NIM1\", \"NPR1\" or \"SAI1\" (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system \"Arabidopsis thaliana\".  SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species.

As early as the \"Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\" (\"Manyōshū\"), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations.  The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time.  People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion.  Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's composition.  The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the \"Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry\" (Kokinshū), the first imperial poetry collection, which was completed around 905.

These organisms do not remain as plankton permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms.  After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor.  Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans and dinoflagellates and diatoms.  Meroplankton forms an algal medium that is found between the loosely mixed sediments and water.  This layer can be re-suspended in the water column by turbulent mixing.  Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement.  Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses.  Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species.  Many of the common, well-known animals found on the Great Barrier Reef spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become.  The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults.  Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year.

As a young man he worked for and came to know Owen Brown and soon acquired strong abolitionist sympathies.  Originally a Jacksonian, Jesse eventually broke with the Democrats as he developed anti-slavery leanings, and for a time wrote a number of controversial editorials in support of abolition and about other issues, including Ulysses at Shiloh.

Otherwise construction began in the center of the district in 1908 and moved outward.  By 1942 all but 15 houses were built.

Camouflage, head and body shape, and advanced sexual anatomy allow this species of turtle to effectively populate much of South America.  Mating occurs during rainy months (March–December) and egg deposit occurs during dry months (January–March).  Males have been known to behave aggressively towards females during copulation by squirting water from nostrils and biting.  A few genomic studies show mosaicism exists among populations of the twist-necked turtle in Surinam.  In other words, diploid and triploid levels exist among individuals at this particular location.  No threats have been reported for this species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature does not have a current listing.  Lack of human consumption due to the species' small size and its wide range explain why scientists are not concerned about this turtle species."}, {"id": "5ab2b89d554299166977406e_ctxchunk_2", "title": "Alternanthera philoxeroides", "chunk": "Alternanthera philoxeroides: Alternanthera philoxeroides, commonly referred to as alligator weed, is a native species to the temperate regions of South America, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

During the early Cenozoic, South America's only land connection was to Antarctica, so it was effectively cut off from most of the world; as the fragments of Gondwana continued to separate, this connection was lost, leaving South America an island continent.  Caviomorph rodents and monkeys arrived as 'waif dispersers' by rafting across the Atlantic from Africa in the Eocene epoch, 35 million or more years ago.  All the remaining nonflying mammals of South America are recent arrivals, having migrated from North America via Central America during the past seven million years as part of the Great American Interchange; this invasion, which peaked around three million years ago, was made possible when the formation of the volcanic Isthmus of Panama bridged North and South America.  The newcomers out-competed and drove to extinction many unique mammals that had evolved during South America's long period of isolation, as well as some species from other classes (e.g., terror birds)."}, {"id": "5ab2b89d554299166977406e_ctxchunk_4", "title": "Nops (spider)", "chunk": "Nops (spider): Nops is a genus of medium-sized caponiid spider native to South America, Central America, and the Caribbean islands.

Based on IUCN data, Mexico has 23% more noncetacean mammal species than the U.S. and Canada combined in an area only 10% as large, or a species density over 12 times that of its northern neighbors.  Mexico's high mammal biodiversity is in part a reflection of the wide array of biomes present over its latitudinal, climatic and altitudinal ranges, from lowland tropical rainforest to temperate desert to montane forest to alpine tundra.  The general increase in terrestrial biodiversity moving towards the equator is another important factor in the comparison.  Mexico includes much of the Mesoamerican and Madrean pine-oak woodlands biodiversity hotspots. From a biogeographic standpoint, most of Mexico is linked to the rest of North America as part of the Nearctic ecozone.  However, the lowlands of southern Mexico are linked with Central America and South America as part of the Neotropic ecozone.  Extensive mixing of Nearctic and Neotropical mammal species commenced only three million years ago, when the formation of the Isthmus of Panama ended South America's long period of isolation and precipitated the Great American Interchange.  Twenty of Mexico's extant nonflying species (opossums, armadillos, anteaters, monkeys and caviomorph rodents) are of South American origin.  Most of the megafauna that formerly inhabited the region became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene about 10,000 years ago, shortly after the arrival of the first humans.

To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the Giants, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco.  (His number during most of his stay with the Pirates, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway).  Bonds hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route to his second consecutive MVP award, and third overall (of an eventual seven).  As good as the Giants were (winning 103 games), the Atlanta Braves won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (due to the Wild Card being instituted the following season).  After going up by nine games August 11 with a 77-38 record, the Giants went 12-18 and found themselves three-and-a-half games behind, a 12.5-game swing, by September 15.  They then went on a 14-2 run, which left them one game behind the Braves with one game remaining, which they lost 12-1 to become the only National League team to win 100 or more games (103) and not make the playoffs in the divisional play era."}, {"id": "5ade18635542997c77aded3e_ctxchunk_8", "title": "Barry Bonds", "chunk": "Barry Bonds: Barry Lamar Bonds (born July 24, 1964) is an American former professional baseball left fielder who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants.

The limit was first indicated in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E. C. Stoner, and was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 19, in India.  This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time.  White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure.  (By comparison, main sequence stars resist collapse through thermal pressure.)  The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit would be subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole.  (However, white dwarfs generally avoid this fate by exploding before they undergo collapse.)  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs."}, {"id": "5a8fdc1e5542995b44242097_ctxchunk_1", "title": "Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor", "chunk": "Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor: In astrophysics, Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor provides the gravitational potential of a body due to its own gravity created by the distribution of matter across the body, named after the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

Estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope; typical values given are from 0.10 to 0.15 (10% to 15% of the total stellar mass).  This is the maximum to which a helium-filled core can grow, and if this limit is exceeded, as can only happen in massive stars, the core collapses, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant.

The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.  It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed.  Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission.  Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type.  This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors.  This eliminates the \"bird caging\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands.  The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys.  The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.  Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs.  The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations.  The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses."}, {"id": "5a7d549f5542991319bc93ad_ctxchunk_3", "title": "Maximum Fighting Championship", "chunk": "Maximum Fighting Championship: Maximum Fighting Championship is a Canadian mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion based in Edmonton, Alberta.

It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33⅓-rpm album.  The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle.

For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables.  Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables.  The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus \"error\" terms.  Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables.  Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset.  Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research and finance.  Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables.  It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality."}, {"id": "5a73668e55429901807db02e_ctxchunk_1", "title": "Oh, with the verbing!", "chunk": "Oh, with the verbing!: Oh, with the verbing!  is a phrase commonly used in TV shows and movies, first used by comedian Jerry Lewis.

Paul married Jadwiga on 5 September 1942, in the hope that gaining French citizenship she'd be protected from deportation.  The couple then moved to Clermont-Ferrand, returning to Nice in 1943 when that city was in Italian control and relatively safe.  However, in September 1943 the Germans re-occupied Nice and danger of deportation returned.  From this time Paul Nguyen hid his wife, her uncle and aunt, Jakub and Salome Berliner and their baby son Roland.  Obtaining false papers in November 1943 he arranged a people smuggler to take Jakub to Switzerland.  He arranged a second journey with Salome Berliner and her infant.  Paul and Jadwiga Nguyen had two daughters.  Yad Vashem recognized Paul as Righteous on 30 April 2007.  Paul Nguyễn Công Anh is the only Vietnamese person so recognized.

The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time.

Unlike repertory companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions.  Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated.  Combination companies contributed to the early success of Broadway theatre, as most combination companies began their tours in New York City.  Combination companies were fueled by stars.  The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company.  The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform.  Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there.  “The engagements of the first important stars… were rare and special events”(Poggi 4).  Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars.  The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star.  The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5).  After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual.  Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them.  They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201).  This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies."}, {"id": "5ab81aef55429916710eaff1_ctxchunk_9", "title": "Selkirk hurdle", "chunk": "Selkirk hurdle: The Selkirk Hurdle is the term used by urban planners, railroad employees, politicians, and others to describe the route that must be taken by freight trains traveling between New York City and other points in downstate New York that are east of the Hudson River, and locations in the United States to the south and west.  There are no rail freight bridges or tunnels that cross the Hudson River south of Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16 km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard.  As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel 140 mi north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way.  Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common.  However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the \"Water Level Route\" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and it is still used by the New York Central's successor, CSX, for traffic to both sides of the Hudson River."}], "supporting_facts": [{"id": "5ab81aef55429916710eaff1_ctxchunk_3", "title": "Revolt of the Beavers", "chunk": "Revolt of the Beavers: Revolt of the Beavers was a children's play put on by the Federal Theater Project by Oscar Saul and Louis Lantz.

It can be thus understood as the differentiation of workers based on characteristics such as color, race, origin, gender etc. that can be classified as factors that do not have a role in determining his or her productivity.  There are multiple dimensions that need to be considered when discussing such discrimination.  The most obvious is that the group discriminated against is paid less for identical jobs.  This is known as wage discrimination and is the most prevalent form of discrimination.  The attempt to combat such a form of discrimination can be seen in increasing equal pay legislation in different countries.  Examples of this are the Equal Pay Act (1970), Sex Discrimination Act (1975), and Employment Protection Act (1975), but the effectiveness of such legislation is subject to much debate.  Secondly, that the level of unemployment for the disadvantaged group in general is higher than that of other groups that do not face such discrimination.  Thirdly, there is discrimination based on the kind of jobs that they have access to, the discriminated group given preference for repetitive and menial tasks.This is known as employment discrimination, where an individual is excluded from a job that is worked on by a person with equal productivity.  When this happens, the disadvantaged group is employed for a job he or she is over-qualified for, simply because the group does not have access to better paying jobs in par to their counterparts and are denied opportunities of recruitment and promotion.

Erwin to manage the enterprise.  The mill’s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin’s and his successors’ exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers.  The mill grew quickly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, became one of North Carolina’s largest cotton mills.  It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to other fabrics, becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s.  Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States.  Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century.

Previously known as Smoky Hollow, this area developed around the Durham Hosiery Mills in the late 19th century.  Durham was a “raw whistle-stop village” along the Great North Carolina Central Rail Road that transformed into one of the largest tobacco cities in the United States.  The Durham City Bull became one of the better-known tobacco trademarks with the help of the big players in the industry, W. T. Blackwell and Company and Julian Carr.  The success of these tobacco mills started overflowing into other industries, mainly textile mills that produced cloth bags, socks, and other hosieries.  As demands rose, communities began growing and changing around the factories.  A shift in the racial make up of the workforce was reflected in Edgemont’s shift to a more African American dominant community as the years progressed.  Julian Carr Jr. was one of the first to allow black workers in factory level jobs to help cope with the high demands.  This industrialist’s decision to reach over the race barrier is part of what made Durham “the City of the New South.”  The Edgemont Neighborhood is just one of many examples of how Durham became one of the more progressive and tolerant locations for African Americans in the country."}, {"id": "5a822d605542995ce29dcccb_ctxchunk_8", "title": "Downtown Durham Historic District", "chunk": "Downtown Durham Historic District: Downtown Durham Historic District is a national historic district located at Durham, Durham County, North Carolina.

Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years.  It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development.  The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product.  These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design.  The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF).  When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted.  As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also.  The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF.  The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualifications/default.asp?area=130.  This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible.  However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded.  On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association."}, {"id": "5ae061705542993d6555eb26_ctxchunk_1", "title": "Whistling in Dixie", "chunk": "Whistling in Dixie: Whistling in Dixie is a 1942 crime comedy film, the second of three starring Red Skelton as murder mystery writer and amateur crime solver Wally Benton (aka.
